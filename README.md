# LDPC-codes-for-Enhanced-Reliability-in-5g-NR-networks

## INTRODUCTION
Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in 5G communication networks. As 5G pushes for higher data rates, lower latency, and improved connectivity, robust error correction is essential. LDPC codes help reduce errors significantly and allow efficient data transmission, even in challenging network conditions. Their ability to closely approach Shannon's limit makes them ideal for modern wireless communication systems, ensuring high-speed and low-latency performance.

## OVERVIEW OF 5G COMMUNICATION
5G is the latest mobile communication technology designed for high-speed, low-latency connectivity. It supports a vast number of devices, enabling advanced applications such as ultra-HD streaming, real-time gaming, IoT, autonomous vehicles, and remote healthcare. LDPC codes enhance 5Gâ€™s efficiency by ensuring accurate and reliable data transmission.

## KEY CONCEPTS
#### What are LDPC Codes?
* LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) codes are advanced error-correcting codes used in digital communication. They introduce redundancy in transmitted data using a sparse 
  parity-check matrix. This redundancy enables error detection and correction, improving transmission reliability over noisy channels.
#### Tanner graph:
* A Tanner graph is a special type of graph used to represent error-correcting codes, like LDPC codes. It is made up of two types of nodes: variable nodes (representing data bits) and check nodes (representing parity checks). The connections (edges) between these nodes show how the data bits are checked for errors.
#### Sparse matrix: 
* A sparse matrix is a matrix (a grid of numbers) where most of the elements are zero. Only a small number of the entries have non-zero values.
#### Generative matrix: 
* A generator matrix is a special matrix used in coding theory to create codewords (which are the data plus extra bits for error correction) from the original data bits. It 
  defines how to take the original data and turn it into a longer string of bits that can be sent or stored with error-correction capabilities.

## PROCESS OF EXECUTION
### Encoding
* The input message bits are processed using a parity-check matrix to generate redundant bits.
* The encoded data, consisting of message and parity bits, is transmitted for further processing.
* Encoding improves error detection and correction efficiency, reducing data loss.
### Modulation
* Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation is applied to map binary data into signal waveforms.
* This step converts digital data into an analog signal for transmission over wireless channels.
* Higher-order modulation schemes (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM) can be used for increased data rates.
### Noisy Channels
* The signal is transmitted through a wireless environment, experiencing fading and noise.
* The Rayleigh and Rician fading models are used to simulate real-world transmission scenarios.
* Channel conditions are analyzed to adaptively adjust transmission parameters.
### ML Model (Regression for Noise Reduction)
* A machine learning regression-based algorithm is applied to predict and mitigate noise distortions.
* This step enhances signal clarity before decoding, improving overall data integrity.
* The model is trained with real-time data to improve accuracy and adaptability.
### Decoding
* The received signal undergoes iterative belief propagation decoding.
* Errors introduced by the noisy channel are corrected by repeatedly updating the message until a reliable output is achieved.
* Soft decision decoding methods improve error correction capabilities.

## IMPLEMENTATION IN MATLAB
* MATLAB is used for simulating LDPC encoding, modulation, noisy channel effects, and decoding. The step-by-step implementation involves:
* Encoding data using an LDPC parity-check matrix.
* Modulating data using BPSK.
* Introducing noise using Rayleigh/Rician fading models.
* Applying machine learning-based noise reduction.
* Decoding data using an iterative belief propagation algorithm.
* Obtaining final result.

### CONCLUSION
LDPC codes are integral to 5G communication, ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission. Their ability to correct errors in high-speed networks makes them vital for emerging applications such as IoT, autonomous vehicles, and ultra-low latency communication. The integration of ML-based noise reduction further enhances signal reliability. By leveraging LDPC codes, 5G networks can achieve better performance, paving the way for future advancements in wireless technology.
